## Abstract

Cybersecurity investment is critical for the financial industry, particularly in developing economies where technological adoption and digital banking are rapidly expanding. This research explores the relationship between cybersecurity investment and financial loss prevention in the Nigerian banking sector between **2016 and 2022**.

Using data from 11 commercial banks in Nigeria, this study applies a **panel regression model (Fixed Effects)** to examine the impact of cybersecurity expenditure on losses attributed to cyber fraud and digital theft. The findings indicate that although there is a **statistically significant negative relationship**, the effect size is small â€” suggesting that while investment reduces losses, it may not be sufficient on its own.

The research concludes that **stronger governance, improved fraud detection systems, and regulatory enforcement** are necessary to complement investment efforts. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of transparent financial disclosures to support future academic and policy-based research.

This dissertation contributes to the growing field of cybersecurity finance and risk management in emerging markets.
