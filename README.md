## 📌 Project Summary

The financial sector in Nigeria faces increasing threats from cybercrime. This study investigates whether cybersecurity investments by Nigerian banks have had a measurable impact on reducing financial losses caused by cyber theft.

Using **panel data regression (Fixed Effects Model)** and data from 11 Nigerian commercial banks between **2016 and 2022**, the research evaluates the relationship between bank investment in cybersecurity and the scale of losses experienced.

## 🧠 Key Findings

- A **1% increase** in cybersecurity investment leads to a **0.41% decrease** in losses due to cyber fraud.
